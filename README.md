#Java Project from 2017/2018
This reposetory is an upload of code I would on a few years back before I used git.
The code is supposed to be seen as entirly **depricated**. And likely will not crash somewhere.
For this reason the project will therefore be licenced as **CLOSED SOURCE**, even if the code is open to be viewed by everyone.

The rought assignment of the exercise was to write a a binary multiplexter in Java. But to be honest I have no Idea what is exactly does.
I sadly lost the assignmet sheet hence I have no Idea who to use the software.

The reposetory is overwelmingly intended to show potential future employees that I'm at least capable of writing Java and documenting and understanding it.
