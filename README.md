# Java Distributed Systems

This reposetory is an upload of code I would on a few years back before I used git. The code is supposed to be seen as entierly depricated. And likely will not crash somewhere. For this reason the project will therefore be licenced as "_WTFPL_" (Do What the Fuck You Want to Public License)

The rought assignment of the exercise was to write a a binary multiplexter in Java. But to be honest I have no Idea what is exactly does.
I sadly lost the assignmet sheet hence I have no Idea who to use the software.

The reposetory is overwelmingly intended to show potential future employees that I'm at least capable of writing Java and documenting and understanding it.
